# Hire Tabs

Tabs. You know and love.

## Example
```javascript
import {Tabs, Tab} from "hire-tabs";
import {SomeComponent, SomeOtherComponents} from "some-component-collection"

class MyTabbedComponent extends React.Component {
	handleTabChange(label, index) {
		let path = `/some-route/${label}`;

		// You could be using ReactRouter
		this.transitionTo(path);
	}

	render() {
		// You could be using ReactRouter
		let tabName = (this.getParams().hasOwnProperty("tab")) ?
			this.getParams().tab :
			"first-tab";

		return (
			<Tabs onChange={this.handleTabChange}>
				<Tab
					active={tabName === "first-tab"}
					label="First Tab">
					<SomeComponent />
				</Tab>
				<Tab
					active={tabName === "second-tab"}
					label="Second Tab">
					<SomeOtherComponent />
				</Tab>
			</Tabs>
		);
	}
}
```

## Why doesn't Hire Tabs have an internal state?

An option would be to let `<Tabs>` have an internal state, which
tracks which `<Tab>` is active and upon state change, renders the required
`<Tab>`. But... This is behaviour which is sometimes unwanted, because you
want the parent component to decide which `<Tab>` is shown. For example, in case of page load and the tab name is in the URL.
